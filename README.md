# My Apple Intelligence

This project is used to discover the ability to build a copy of Apple Intelligence myself. Currently, it covers building the following two features:

- Writing Tools
- Image Playground

The focus when building this project was all about:

- UX
- Open-Source
- On-device

This project is used as a testiment for my talk at the [Do iOS Conference](https://do-ios.com) in Amsterdam on November 13-14.

It's not a perfectly running app, but in the end it's possible to use it to run the features mentioned fully on-device.

If you enjoy the project, feel free to [follow me on X](https://x.com/stefanjblos) to learn more about it.
